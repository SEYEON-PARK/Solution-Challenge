## What's different about this service

1. One-On-One atching
2. One-time matching
3. Anonymity

## The problem we want to solve

We chose ‘Good Health & Wellbeing’, the third goal of UN-SDGs. When people think of ‘health’, they often think of physical health, but we believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. As we mentioned above, we noticed that people often feel difficult emotions but do not express them outwardly. We thought that if someone keeps their difficult emotions to themselves for a long time, it could lead to a mental disorder.

#### Mental Health Concerns_Worrying about how others perceive oneself and struggling to express one's emotions effectively. So, it is difficult for someone to confide in others about their emotions and, even when seeking comfort, it is challenging to receive it.
